My Experience was very frustrating on this application. I think that was mainly due to traveling and being behind and stressed because of it however. I got a lot of the things right but I’m still not 100% on how to subclass things and work with elements. I think it’s also frustrating because I know how to do it in other languages easier. I also am not clear when I should be using self. and _self when initializing. I was having errors. 

I have a bit of a hard time wrapping my head around how the application should be setup or if I did it correctly. I did have fun though even though I wasn’t successful in every extra attempt I made to enhance the application.

Here’s a few things I added to the application:

* Added the ability to hit return in the address field
* Added an additional Email field
* Setup Email Address with a button to pull up the mailto: address
* Added custom fonts, but I would love more control too
* Customized the save panel to use the profiles name as the suggested filename while trimming off any spaces as well
* Attempted to add a placeholder to Notes but couldn’t quite pull everything together.
* Ensured formatting in Google & Bing Maps was pretty solid in the Site’s Input Field
* UI update when the nib is loaded and window is main (not sure if this is a feature or a bug though)

The videos made it very helpful to pull this assignment together. That was one of my best resources. StackOverflow helped in a few instances and out class chat helped me out as well. But for the most part since I was traveling a lot in Wisconsin without internet my biggest resource was the videos done by Marty.

I really feel like this type of app would benefit from a Table List view to collect the profiles.  I would really like to understand the setup of a window controller compared to the app delegate and how it ties into the app delegate specifically with initialization and deeper understanding of their roles.
